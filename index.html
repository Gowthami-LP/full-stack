    <p>It is a popular Indian street food variation made with hot and crispy Aloo Samosa topped with tangy spicy chutneys and ragda, this one is surely a treat for your taste buds. There are many ways to make it as many prefer to have it with channa or chole, but in this recipe, matar gravy or ragda is used. I also share a crispy samosa recipe which you can make in advance and serve with ragda and chutney.</p>

The makers of Aegan noticed Sivakarthikeyan and offered him a supporting role, but his portions didn't make the final cut.[</P>
